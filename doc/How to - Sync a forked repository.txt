# Add the remote, call it "upstream":

git remote add upstream https://github.com/planeur-net/outlanding

# Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches

git fetch upstream

# Make sure that you're on your master branch:

git checkout main

# Rewrite your master branch so that any commits of yours that
# aren't already in upstream/master are replayed on top of that
# other branch:

git reset --hard upstream/main

# Push change to repo
git push -f origin main
